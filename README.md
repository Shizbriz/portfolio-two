**WELCOME**

What do you say about yourself in a Readme?
Well, 
I'm Oluwaseyi, a laid back yet energetic front end developer and microbiologist (BSc., MSc.). 

Why create a portfolio when you don't have any life project?
I've worked on a few personal projects, I think they're nice and I hope you'd think so too.

Where's the professionalism characteristic of documents used for job applications?
Request for my curriculum vitae and cover letter, they're dripping with politeness and formality.

How can you be contacted for further questions and/or requests?
My contact details are in this portfolio, check it out.


*Have a wonderful day!*
